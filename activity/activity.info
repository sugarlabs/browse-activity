    <p>To help in researching, Browse offers many features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bookmark (save) good pages you find - never loose good resources or forget to add them to your bibliography</li>
        <li>Bookmark pages with collaborators in real time - great for researching as a group or teachers showing pages to their class</li>
        <li>Comment on your bookmarked pages - a great tool for making curated collections</li>
    </ul>
