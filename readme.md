<h1>Browser-activity</h1>
this is a python generated activity to browse the internet using webkit on gtk+ on sugar toolkit
Sugar includes a Mozilla-Firefox-derived (Gecko) Web Browser Activity. 
<p>This browser includes HTML, XHTML, Javascript and SVG support. 
we can set up simple web-servers on a laptop using Python, or children may access an application hosted on a public web server </p>

we can develop for this platform with no particular hardware or setup, and can test using regular Firefox during initial stages. 
It is easy to port work from elsewhere into this stack, and easy to export your work for use outside of the OLPC project. The environment is, however, rather constrained,
without access to most of the special hardware or software components on the laptop.
